A set of puzzles I created for Eugene to solve on his birthday.

## How it works
Everything for the puzzle itself is contained within the [puzzle](puzzle) folder. If you want to give it a try, keep in mind that it was created for a specific person. That said, 3 of the 4 puzzles have enough information within them to be independently solvable, the other would not be possible without knowing Eugene. I'm keeping this section intentionally vague to avoid spoilers, though I think when you look at the 4 puzzles it should be apparent which one this refers to.

## Solutions
I will add a solution file in the near future which explains the answers.

## Making the puzzle
The thought process behind making a puzzle and how to do so in such a way that you create an enjoyable experience is really interesting. I will also add my thoughts on this and explain my decision making process for these particular puzzles soon.
