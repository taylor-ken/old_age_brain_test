Each vegetable folder contains a puzzle. Put the answers to the 4 puzzles below, then figure out what to do next. 
Hints are available for each puzzle, try to solve without them. They can be solved in any order so you can move on and come back if needed.
Hint 1 is intended to be less of a hint than hint 2, so start with just 1 if needed*.

* Using hints may be an indication of cognitive decline and/or cause loss of respect.
